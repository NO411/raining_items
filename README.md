# Raining Items
by NO11

Minetest but it's raining random items!

Play PvP with your friends on a server and get random items and blocks. Or try to kill the enderdragon in MineClone2 with the help of these items!

Important: Set down Item-Entity-TTL (or item_entity_ttl) in your minetest settings to 60 - 120 because of performance reasons.
